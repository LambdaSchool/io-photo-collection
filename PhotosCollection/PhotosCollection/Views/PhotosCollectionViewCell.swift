/*
 Delegate Pattern Checklist
 - Protocol. What does the employee need to do for the customer?
    - Order food
    - Update a collection view on another view controller
    - Save a model object
 - Who is the delegator (Customer)?
 - Who is the delegate (Employee)?
 - Adopt/conform to the protocol on the delegate
 - A place where both the delegate and the delegator exist. Set the delegator's `.delegate` property (generally) to `self`.
    - VC -> VC: prepareForSegue
    - Cell -> View: cellForRow or cellForItem
 - The delegator needs to tell the delegate to run its function(s) from the protocol at the appropriate time. When a button is tapped, switch is flipped, etc.
